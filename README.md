## Description
ðŸ—’
An Express.js API using Sequelize with MySQL to create and use a database through different end points. Allows the user to browse all, search for one, create new, or update categories, products, and tags. 
<br>
<br>

## Installation
âœ…
First, you will need to clone this repository to your computer. Once in the root directory, run  `npm install`. You will then need to log into MySQL shell and run `source db/schema.sql;` to create the database. Next, open the `.env(sample)` file and insert your MySQL username and password. Then, remove the `(sample)` from the `.env(sample)` filename or this will not run as intended.
